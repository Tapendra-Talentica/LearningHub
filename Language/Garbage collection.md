# Garbage Collection in JavaScript and Node.js

Garbage Collection (GC) in **JavaScript** and **Node.js** is an automatic process that helps manage memory by cleaning up unused or unreachable objects, freeing up space for new data. The process ensures efficient memory usage, prevents memory leaks, and optimizes application performance.

## What is Garbage Collection?

Garbage Collection is the process of finding and deleting "garbage"â€”data in memory that is no longer needed by the program. When an object no longer has any references pointing to it, or it cannot be reached from any root reference, it becomes "unreachable" and is considered garbage.

## Benefits of Garbage Collection

1. **Memory Management**: Efficient memory management ensures that your application doesn't use more memory than necessary.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Freeing up memory used by unused objects improves performance and prevents memory leaks.
3. **Avoiding Crashes**: Proper memory management helps prevent crashes due to running out of memory, especially in long-running applications.

## Garbage Collection Algorithms

### 1. Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm

#### How It Works
The garbage collector periodically stops the program execution to identify and clean up unused objects.

- **Mark Phase**: It starts from the root and marks all reachable objects.
- **Sweep Phase**: It then looks for unmarked objects (those that are not reachable) and deletes them, freeing up memory.

### 2. Generational Garbage Collection

The V8 engine (used by Node.js and Chrome) uses **Generational Garbage Collection**, which divides memory into two parts:

- **Young Generation**: Stores newly created objects. These objects are checked frequently because most objects quickly become unused.
- **Old Generation**: Stores objects that have survived the young generation's checks. Objects that remain in memory for a longer time move to the old generation.

#### Minor and Major Garbage Collections

- **Minor GC**: Focuses on the young generation. It is fast and runs frequently to clean up short-lived objects.
- **Major GC**: Focuses on the old generation. It is less frequent but more comprehensive, scanning and cleaning objects that have been around longer.

## Best Practices to Help Garbage Collection

1. **Avoid Memory Leaks**: Be careful with global variables, event listeners, and references that are no longer needed.
2. **Use `let` and `const` Over `var`**: This helps reduce the chance of accidentally creating global variables, which can lead to memory leaks.
3. **Close Resources**: Manually close resources like database connections or file handles when they are no longer needed.
4. **Avoid Circular References**: Ensure objects do not reference each other in ways that prevent the garbage collector from freeing them.

### Example of Circular References

```javascript
let obj1 = {};
let obj2 = {};

obj1.ref = obj2;
obj2.ref = obj1;
