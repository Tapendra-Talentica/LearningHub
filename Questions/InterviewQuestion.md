Here are the answers to all your questions in a detailed and easy-to-understand manner:

### Q1. Call vs Apply vs Bind

`call`, `apply`, and `bind` are methods that allow you to invoke functions in different contexts (i.e., with different values of `this`).

- **`call`**: Invokes a function immediately, allowing you to pass arguments one by one.
  
- **`apply`**: Invokes a function immediately, allowing you to pass arguments as an array.

- **`bind`**: Returns a new function with a specific context (`this` value) and optional arguments. It does not call the function immediately; it creates a new one with a bound context.

**Demo:**

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  greet: function(age) {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${age} years old.`);
  }
};

const anotherPerson = { name: 'Jane' };

// Call
person.greet.call(anotherPerson, 25); // Output: Hello, my name is Jane and I am 25 years old.

// Apply
person.greet.apply(anotherPerson, [30]); // Output: Hello, my name is Jane and I am 30 years old.

// Bind
const boundGreet = person.greet.bind(anotherPerson, 35);
boundGreet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Jane and I am 35 years old.
```

### Q2. Map vs Filter

- **`map`**: Creates a new array by applying a function to every element in the array.

- **`filter`**: Creates a new array containing only the elements that meet a certain condition.

**Demo:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Map: Multiply each element by 2
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// Filter: Keep only even numbers
const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]
```

### Q3. Function Currying Example

**Function currying** is a technique of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument.

**Example:**

```javascript
function add(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return function(c) {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
}

console.log(add(2)(3)(5)); // Output: 10
```

### Q4. Event Loop

The **event loop** in JavaScript is a mechanism that allows asynchronous code to execute non-blocking. It continuously checks if the call stack is empty and then processes the callbacks in the callback queue.

- JavaScript is single-threaded; it uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations like I/O, timers, etc.
  
**Example of Event Loop:**

```javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout');
}, 0);

console.log('End');

// Output:
// Start
// End
// Timeout
```

### Q5. Libraries in Node.js

Some popular libraries in Node.js:

- **Express**: Web framework for building APIs.
- **Mongoose**: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests.
- **Lodash**: Utility library for JavaScript functions.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For working with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

### Q6. What is Middleware? Name any.

**Middleware** is a function in Node.js that has access to the request and response objects and can modify them, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function in the stack.

**Example: Logging Middleware**

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} request to ${req.url}`);
  next();
});
```

### Q7. What are Closures in JavaScript?

**Closures** are functions that have access to variables from their outer (enclosing) function even after the outer function has returned.

**Example:**

```javascript
function outer() {
  const outerVar = 'I am outside!';
  return function inner() {
    console.log(outerVar);
  };
}

const innerFunc = outer();
innerFunc(); // Output: I am outside!
```

### Q8. Definition for Function `add(4)(5)(1)();`

This function uses **currying**. It keeps accepting arguments until it encounters an empty call `()`, at which point it returns the sum.

**Implementation:**

```javascript
function add(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return function(c) {
      return function() {
        return a + b + c;
      };
    };
  };
}

console.log(add(4)(5)(1)()); // Output: 10
```

### Q9. Make the Sum Function Typed

If using **TypeScript**, you can make `sum` typed:

```typescript
const sum = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;
```

### Q10. Solve `Sum(3)(4)(2)` in JavaScript

This uses **currying** to create a chain of function calls.

**Example:**

```javascript
function sum(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return function(c) {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
}

console.log(sum(3)(4)(2)); // Output: 9
```

### Q11. Write a Debounce Function

A **debounce** function ensures that a function is not called again until a certain amount of time has passed.

**Example:**

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

// Usage
const debouncedFunc = debounce(() => console.log('Debounced!'), 1000);
window.addEventListener('resize', debouncedFunc);
```

### Q12. Function to Print Nested Properties of an Object

**Recursive Function Example:**

```javascript
function printNestedProperties(obj, prefix = '') {
  for (const key in obj) {
    if (typeof obj[key] === 'object') {
      printNestedProperties(obj[key], `${prefix}${key}.`);
    } else {
      console.log(`${prefix}${key}: ${obj[key]}`);
    }
  }
}

const exampleObj = { a: 1, b: { c: 2, d: { e: 3 } } };
printNestedProperties(exampleObj);
```

### Q13. Need and Purpose of NestJS

**NestJS** is a framework for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. It uses TypeScript and is built on top of Express or Fastify. It helps organize your code into modules and offers built-in features for routing, middleware, validation, and more.

### Q14. Server-Side Rendering

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** is a technique where the server generates the HTML content of a web page and sends it to the client, providing faster initial load times and improved SEO.

### Q15. How to Do Rendering in NestJS?

In NestJS, you can use the `@Render` decorator to specify a template engine and render a view.

**Example:**

```typescript
@Controller('home')
export class HomeController {
  @Get()
  @Render('index')
  getHome() {
    return { message: 'Hello, World!' };
  }
}
```

### Q16. What is an Event Loop?

The **event loop** is a mechanism in JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks. It checks if the call stack is empty and processes the callback queue to execute asynchronous code.

### Q17. Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Tasks

- **Synchronous**: Tasks are executed in sequence, blocking further execution until the current task is complete.
  
- **Asynchronous**: Tasks are executed non-blocking, allowing other tasks to run while waiting for completion (e.g., I/O operations).

### Q18. Purpose of the `package.json` File

`package.json` is a configuration file in Node.js that defines the metadata, scripts, dependencies, and versions of the application or package.

### Q19. How to Handle Errors in Node.js?

You can handle errors using:

1. **`try/catch` blocks**: For synchronous code.
2. **Error-handling middleware**: In Express.
3. **`process.on('uncaughtException')`**: For catching uncaught exceptions.

### Q20. Node.js Garbage Collection: Old Space vs New Space

- **New Space**: Where newly created objects are stored. The garbage collector quickly removes unreachable objects.
- **Old Space**: Where long-lived objects are stored after surviving multiple garbage collection cycles.

### Q21. Common Debugging Techniques in Node.js

- **Using `console.log`**: Simple but effective.
- **Node.js Debugger**: Using `node inspect`.
- **Chrome DevTools**: For visual debugging.
- **VSCode Debugger**: For an integrated debugging environment.

### Q22. Use Cases of Docker and Debugging in Containers

- **Use Cases**: Isolate environments, deploy applications consistently, manage dependencies.
- **Debugging**: Use Docker’s `logs` and `exec` commands, or integrate with IDEs.

### Q23. Create a Server and Route Using HTTP Module

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/' && req.method

 === 'GET') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Hello, World!');
  } else {
    res.writeHead(404);
    res.end('Not Found');
  }
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

### Q24. Write an Error Handling Middleware

**Error Handling Middleware:**

```javascript
function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.message);
  res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
}

// Usage in Express
app.use(errorHandler);
```

### Q25. Implement Caching in the Created Server

You can use **Redis** or **Memory Cache**:

**Example: Memory Cache:**

```javascript
const cache = new Map();

function cacheMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  const key = req.url;
  if (cache.has(key)) {
    return res.send(cache.get(key));
  }
  res.sendResponse = res.send;
  res.send = (body) => {
    cache.set(key, body);
    res.sendResponse(body);
  };
  next();
}

// Usage
app.use(cacheMiddleware);
```

### Q26. Handle File Uploading Using FS in Node.js

Use `multer` for handling multipart/form-data.

```javascript
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('File uploaded!');
});
```

### Q27. Read Data from File Line by Line

Use `readline` module:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const readline = require('readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: fs.createReadStream('file.txt'),
});

rl.on('line', (line) => {
  console.log(line);
});
```

### Q28. Handle Event Emitting

Use Node.js’s `EventEmitter`:

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

myEmitter.on('event', () => {
  console.log('An event occurred!');
});

myEmitter.emit('event');
```

### Q29. Optimize a Slow Database Query

- **Use Indexes**: Ensure proper indexing on columns used in queries.
- **Optimize Query Structure**: Avoid `SELECT *`, use specific fields.
- **Database Configuration**: Tune the database for performance.
- **Caching**: Use Redis or in-memory caching to store results of frequent queries.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination to reduce data load.

Feel free to ask for further clarification or details on any specific topic!

### `import` vs `require`

- **`require`:** CommonJS module system used in Node.js. Synchronous and works in all Node.js versions.
- **`import`:** ES6 module system, mostly used in modern JavaScript. It is asynchronous and works natively in newer versions of Node.js or with Babel transpilation.

### Middlewares

Middlewares are functions in Express.js that have access to the `req`, `res`, and `next` objects. They can modify the request and response or terminate the request-response cycle. Examples include authentication, logging, and parsing request bodies.

---

### Callback Hell

Callback hell refers to deeply nested callbacks, which makes the code difficult to read and maintain. It often occurs when dealing with asynchronous code in JavaScript.

Example:
```javascript
asyncFunction1((err, result1) => {
  asyncFunction2(result1, (err, result2) => {
    asyncFunction3(result2, (err, result3) => {
      // More nested callbacks...
    });
  });
});
```

---

### Promises

Promises represent an eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

Example:
```javascript
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // async operation
  if(success) resolve(result);
  else reject(error);
});
```

---

### Async/Await

`async/await` is syntactic sugar for working with Promises, providing cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.

Example:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    let data = await fetchAPI();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

---

### Promise.all

`Promise.all` takes an array of Promises and resolves when all promises are resolved. It returns an array of results. If any promise fails, `Promise.all` will reject.

Example:
```javascript
Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then(results => {
    console.log(results);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

---

### Running 5 Promises in Parallel, Moving Forward When Any 2 Resolve

You can use `Promise.race()` in combination with tracking the resolved promises:

```javascript
async function runInParallel(promises) {
  let resolvedPromises = [];
  
  while (resolvedPromises.length < 2) {
    const result = await Promise.race(promises);
    resolvedPromises.push(result);
    promises = promises.filter(p => p !== result); // Remove resolved promise
  }
  
  // Continue processing after two promises are resolved
}
```

### Tracing a Bug in Production

To trace a bug in production, I typically use logging and monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Sentry) to track errors. For example, in a food delivery system, we encountered a bug where the order status was not updated correctly. By logging the order status changes and checking the logs, we traced the issue to a missing database update in a certain flow of the code.

---

### MVC Structure in Express

- **Model:** Represents the data (e.g., database interaction).
- **View:** Represents the user interface (e.g., templates or frontend code).
- **Controller:** Handles the logic and responds to user input (e.g., routes and request handling).

Example:
- **Model:** Defines the schema for users or products in the database.
- **View:** Renders the product page with data from the controller.
- **Controller:** Receives a request to view a product, fetches the data, and passes it to the view for rendering.



###     How do you debug a bug? finding the root cause & steps to resolve it. examples from past projects 

Debugging a bug is a critical skill for a developer. I'll walk you through a general process I follow to debug in **Node.js**, along with examples from past projects like **BlueVerse** and **BiteTime**. Here are the key steps:

### 1. **Reproduce the Bug**
   - **Goal**: Confirm the bug exists and understand the conditions under which it occurs.
   - **Steps**:
     - Run the code in the same environment where the bug was reported (e.g., production or a specific environment).
     - If needed, add sample inputs or actions that trigger the bug.
   
   - **Example (BlueVerse)**: 
     In BlueVerse, there was an issue where the transaction history was not being recorded correctly for certain machines. To reproduce the bug, I went through specific transaction flows and verified that some transactions were indeed missing.

### 2. **Check Logs and Error Messages**
   - **Goal**: Look at the logs to gather more information about the issue.
   - **Steps**:
     - Check server logs, error logs, and request/response logs.
     - If logging is insufficient, add more detailed logs in the suspicious parts of the code.
   
   - **Example (BiteTime)**:
     We encountered a bug where some food orders were not being marked as "delivered." In the logs, I noticed that the delivery status update was failing silently. After adding more granular logs around the `statusUpdate()` function, I found that the issue was due to missing delivery IDs in some cases.

### 3. **Use Debugging Tools**
   - **Goal**: Step through the code to better understand what's happening.
   - **Steps**:
     - Use the built-in Node.js debugger (`node inspect`), or integrate with a tool like **VSCode**’s debugger.
     - Set breakpoints in the code where you suspect the bug might be happening.
     - Step through the code line by line, inspecting variable values.
   
   - **Example**:
     In BlueVerse, there was an issue with machine wash count totals. I used VSCode's debugger to step through the logic of the wash count update process, eventually finding a race condition where multiple updates were happening simultaneously, overwriting the correct totals.

### 4. **Isolate the Bug**
   - **Goal**: Narrow down the specific piece of code causing the issue.
   - **Steps**:
     - Identify the module or function responsible for the bug.
     - Add `console.log()` or `debugger;` statements at key points to track the flow of data.
     - Eliminate sections of code until you pinpoint where things go wrong.

   - **Example**:
     In BiteTime, there was an issue where payment was processed twice for a single order. By isolating the payment flow, I realized that retries were happening without proper check on the initial payment status. Adding more logic to handle payment retries resolved the issue.

### 5. **Analyze Root Cause**
   - **Goal**: Identify the fundamental problem behind the bug.
   - **Steps**:
     - Ask "Why" multiple times until you get to the core issue.
     - Review the logic flow, architecture, or assumptions made in the code.
     - Think about recent code changes that may have introduced the bug.
   
   - **Example**:
     In BlueVerse, the bug where machine transaction history wasn’t getting recorded was traced back to an issue with Redis caching. The cache wasn’t updating properly after the transaction, which led to stale data. The root cause was improper cache invalidation.

### 6. **Test and Apply a Fix**
   - **Goal**: Fix the bug, making sure it resolves the issue without introducing new problems.
   - **Steps**:
     - Based on the root cause analysis, modify the code to fix the issue.
     - Write unit and integration tests around the bug to ensure it’s fixed.
     - Test the fix in different scenarios to ensure it doesn’t break other parts of the system.
   
   - **Example**:
     In BiteTime, I fixed the payment retry issue by adding a check before initiating retries to confirm that the payment hadn’t already been processed. I added unit tests around the retry logic to make sure no more double payments would occur.

### 7. **Review the Fix in Production**
   - **Goal**: Confirm the bug is completely resolved in the live environment.
   - **Steps**:
     - Deploy the fix to production or the appropriate environment.
     - Monitor the logs, metrics, and user feedback to ensure everything works as expected.
     - Verify with the team that the fix didn’t introduce other bugs.
   
   - **Example**:
     After deploying the payment fix in BiteTime, I closely monitored the logs for any unusual activity and checked payment transaction records over the next few days. Everything functioned smoothly, and the bug was fully resolved.

### 8. **Document the Bug and the Fix**
   - **Goal**: Ensure there’s a record of the bug and how it was fixed for future reference.
   - **Steps**:
     - Add detailed documentation in the project’s bug tracker.
     - If the issue was related to bad code practices, consider setting up a code review to prevent similar issues in the future.

###     Tell about a challenging problem/bug from past projects where you proposed a solution, and it was implemented. 
In one of my past projects, **BlueVerse** (a vehicle wash machine management system), we encountered a particularly challenging issue involving **race conditions** during high-traffic periods when multiple machines were processing transactions simultaneously. The bug manifested as inconsistent machine wash count totals and occasionally incorrect transaction history data.

### Problem:
The core issue was that the vehicle wash machines were sending concurrent requests to update transaction history and wash counts in the system. Since these requests were handled asynchronously by the Node.js backend, multiple transactions for the same machine would sometimes overlap, causing data inconsistencies. For example:
- A machine would register 5 washes, but the database would only reflect 3 or 4.
- Transaction history records would be incomplete or out of order.

This was a serious issue, as accurate wash counts and transaction records are critical for billing and performance tracking.

### Investigation:
To identify the root cause, I followed a systematic approach:

1. **Reproduce the Issue**: 
   I set up test environments where multiple machines (simulated) were sending wash transaction data at almost the same time. This environment mimicked a real-world high-load scenario and allowed me to consistently reproduce the issue.

2. **Analyze Logs and Errors**:
   I closely examined the logs and noticed that transactions were often processed at the same time (near-millisecond timestamps) for the same machine. This indicated a race condition in the logic that updated the machine's wash count.

3. **Isolate the Problem**:
   Using detailed logging and stepping through the code with the debugger, I identified that the issue lay in the database update queries:
   - Each transaction would fetch the current wash count from the database.
   - Multiple transactions would fetch the same count and then attempt to update it simultaneously, causing some updates to overwrite others.

4. **Analyze Root Cause**:
   The root cause was that the updates to the wash count and transaction history were not atomic. This led to **race conditions**, where multiple processes were accessing and modifying shared data without proper synchronization.

### Solution Proposal:

To address the race condition, I proposed two key changes:

1. **Atomic Updates Using Database Transactions**:
   I suggested wrapping the wash count update and transaction history insertion in a single **Postgres transaction**. This would ensure that both operations would either succeed or fail together, preventing partial updates. This approach would also help in retrying the entire operation if any part of the transaction failed.

   In Sequelize (our ORM), I implemented it as follows:
   ```js
   const { sequelize } = require('../models'); // assuming Sequelize models are imported

   async function updateWashCountAndTransaction(machineId, washDetails) {
     const transaction = await sequelize.transaction();
     try {
       const machine = await Machine.findByPk(machineId, { transaction });
       
       // Fetch current wash count
       const currentWashCount = machine.washCount;
       
       // Increment the wash count
       machine.washCount = currentWashCount + 1;
       
       // Save updated wash count
       await machine.save({ transaction });
       
       // Insert new transaction history record
       await TransactionHistory.create({
         machineId,
         details: washDetails,
       }, { transaction });

       // Commit the transaction to ensure atomicity
       await transaction.commit();
     } catch (error) {
       // If something goes wrong, rollback
       await transaction.rollback();
       throw error;
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Locking Mechanism**:
   To prevent multiple requests from simultaneously updating the same machine, I proposed introducing a **locking mechanism** at the database level using Postgres' `FOR UPDATE` clause. This would lock the row being updated, preventing other transactions from reading or writing to it until the current transaction was complete.

   I implemented row-level locking in Sequelize like this:
   ```js
   const machine = await Machine.findOne({
     where: { id: machineId },
     lock: true, // this adds the FOR UPDATE clause
     transaction,
   });
   ```

### Implementation:
Once the solution was proposed and approved, I implemented it in the production codebase, ensuring the following:
- **Comprehensive Unit Testing**: I wrote unit tests to cover all edge cases, including when multiple transactions attempted to update the wash count at the same time. I also tested failure scenarios to ensure that the rollback mechanism worked as expected.
- **Load Testing**: After implementing the solution, I simulated high traffic in a staging environment, where dozens of machines would send simultaneous transaction requests. The solution held up under load, and the wash counts remained consistent.

### Results:
After deploying the fix to production, we observed:
1. **No More Inconsistent Wash Counts**: The wash count for each machine was correctly updated, even when multiple machines were active at the same time.
2. **Correct Transaction History**: All transaction records were accurate and in the correct order, with no missing or out-of-order entries.
3. **Increased Reliability Under Load**: The system became significantly more reliable during peak hours, preventing data corruption or inconsistency.

### Lessons Learned:
1. **Handling Race Conditions in High-Concurrency Systems**: This experience deepened my understanding of race conditions in asynchronous environments like Node.js. I learned how critical it is to manage concurrent access to shared resources properly, especially in high-traffic applications.
   
2. **Importance of Atomicity**: The need to group related database operations in a transaction to ensure consistency was reinforced.

3. **Proper Use of Locking Mechanisms**: Introducing locking in the database ensured data consistency, but I also learned to balance performance with locking to avoid unnecessary bottlenecks.

By addressing the root cause with database transactions and row-level locking, I was able to propose and implement a robust solution that resolved the race condition issue without sacrificing performance.
