Error handling is critical part of building and application
It ensure that your application can handle expected and unexpected error without crashing application 

Approch to handle error handling
1. Use try...catch for synchronous code, to catch and hadle errors
    : If an error occurs inside the try block, it will be caught by the catch block, where you can handle it appropriately

2. Using Error-First Callbacks
    In Node.js applications, many asynchronous functions use error-first callbacks. These callbacks have the first parameter as an error (if any), followed by the result data.
    ``` fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error('Error reading file:', err.message);
        return;
    }
    console.log('File content:', data); 
}); ```

3. Using Promises and .catch()
    Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations. You can use .catch() to handle errors when working with promises.

4. Using async/await with try...catch
     The async/await syntax provides a more synchronous-like way to write asynchronous code, making it easier to read and handle errors.

5. Centralized Error Handling with Middleware
    frameworks like Express.js, using centralized error-handling middleware is a good practice to manage errors in a single place

    ``` 
    app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
        // Simulating an error
        const error = new Error('Something went wrong!');
        error.status = 500;
        next(error); // Passing error to the next middleware
    });

    // Error-handling middleware
    app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
        console.error('Error:', err.message);
        res.status(err.status || 500).json({ error: err.message });
    });
```
Best Practise for error handling in Nodejs

1. Always handle error : Never leave error unhandled
2. Use Meaningful Error message : Provide meaningful error msg
3. Log Errors Properly: Log error with enough context to help debug
4. Graceful Shutdown::  In case of a critical error, perform a graceful shutdown, freeing up resources like database connections, file handles, etc.
5. Centralize Error Handling: For larger applications, centralize error handling in middleware or utility functions to avoid repetitive code.
6. Avoid Leaking Sensitive Information: Do not expose sensitive information to end users

* Global Level Error Handling
It prevent your app from crashing due to unexpected errors

I. Types of Errors:

Synchronous Errors: Errors that happen immediately when the code is executed (e.g., throw new Error("Something went wrong!")).
Asynchronous Errors: Errors that occur in callbacks or async operations (e.g., a failed database query).

II. Handling Uncaught Exceptions:

Use process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => { ... }) to handle errors not caught by other means. This approach prevents the app from crashing but should be used carefully, as it could lead to an unstable state.

III. Promise Rejections:

Use process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => { ... }) to handle unhandled promise rejections. This is important in a Node.js app using Promises or async/await to handle async operations.

IV. Best Practices:

Use try/catch for synchronous code and Promise.catch() for async operations.
Prefer more localized error handling rather than relying solely on global handlers, as it makes debugging easier.
