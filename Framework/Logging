Logging is the practice of recording application activities, which helps in monitoring, debugging, and auditing:

## Types of Logs:

* Error Logs: Record when errors occur.
* Warning Logs: Record non-critical issues that could become errors.
* Info Logs: Record general information about app operations (e.g., a user logged in).
* Debug Logs: Provide detailed information for debugging purposes.

## Best Practices:

* Use Structured Logging: Instead of plain text, use a structured format like JSON. This makes logs easier to search and analyze.
* Log Rotation: Regularly archive or delete old logs to prevent disk space issues.
* Centralize Logs: Use centralized logging services (e.g., ElasticSearch, Loggly) to aggregate logs from different servers.
* Avoid Sensitive Information: Never log sensitive data like passwords or credit card numbers.
* Use Correlation IDs: Include unique IDs in log entries to track related events across multiple systems or microservices.
