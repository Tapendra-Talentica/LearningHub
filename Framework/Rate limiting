Rate limiting in Node.js is a technique used to control the amount of incoming traffic to a server. It restricts the number of requests a user, IP address, or client can make to an API or server within a certain period.

Importance
1. Preventing Abuse: Rate limiting protects your server from malicious users or bots attempting to flood it with requests, a technique often used in denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
2. Fair Usage: Ensures all users have equal access to your service by preventing a single user from monopolizing resources.
3. Cost Management: Helps manage costs by preventing excessive usage that might incur extra charges, especially when you rely on third-party services.
4. Maintaining Performance: By controlling the number of requests, you ensure your server remains responsive and maintains performance under heavy traffic.

Methods for implementation

1. Token Bucket Algorithm: The most common method for rate limiting. It works like a bucket with a fixed capacity that fills with tokens at a certain rate. Each request takes a token from the bucket, and if there are no tokens left, the request is rejected.
2. Leaky Bucket Algorithm: Works like a bucket with a hole in it. The requests are added to the bucket, but they are processed at a fixed rate. If the bucket overflows due to too many requests, excess requests are dropped.
3. Fixed Window Algorithm: Tracks the number of requests in fixed time windows (e.g., per minute or per hour). If the count exceeds the limit, requests are blocked until the next window.
4. Sliding Window Log Algorithm: Similar to the fixed window, but it logs each requestâ€™s timestamp and checks if the count exceeds the limit within a sliding time frame (e.g., the last 10 minutes).
